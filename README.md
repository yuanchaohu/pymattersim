molecular dynamics simulations analysis

Simulators:
1. LAMMPS
   1. atom type & molecular type such as patchy particle, rigid body, molecules et al.
   2. x, xs, xu type particle positions
   3. orthagonal / triclinic box
2. Hoomd-blue
   1. GSD for structure analysis
   2. GSD + DCD for dynamics analysis
3. VASP (to be added)
4. Any type of simulators as long as the input were formatted well
